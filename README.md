# FastHTML Web App

Welcome to my **FastHTML Web App**, a minimalist web application built using the Python FastHTML framework!  This project demonstrates how to create lightweight, efficient web applications without the need for complex setups. Perfect for learning or showcasing small-scale projects. Let's dive in!

## Features

- **Minimal Setup**: FastHTML makes it super easy to get started with web development.
- **Dynamic HTML Rendering**: Learn how to serve dynamic HTML directly from Python scripts.
- **Customizable**: The app is simple, clean, and can be easily adapted to your needs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or newer.
- Installed FastHTML framework.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fasthtml-webapp.git
    cd fasthtml-webapp
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (highly recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
    env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install python-fasthtml
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the server by running the `app.py` script:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open your favorite web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:8000
    ```

3. Voilà! Your web app is up and running. You’ll see a clean, responsive webpage with a button linking to the official FastHTML site.

## Example Workflow

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies (steps above).
2. Modify the HTML content inside the `app.py` script to suit your project.
3. Run the app and check the changes in your browser.
4. Share your FastHTML-powered web app with the world!
